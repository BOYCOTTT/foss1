Semester-wise Exam

According to the semester-wise planning of KTU, the examinations for 1st and 3rd semester were supposed to be held on December 2nd. The timetable was announced weeks before the so-called date and it caused a widespread protest from the student associations. The dates meant that 1st-year students will have to write the exam in the morning session  while the 3rd-semester students will have to write the exam in the after session. This meant that the 3rd-semester students who had papers to be cleared in the 1st semester will have to prepare to write for 2 exams a day.
